SMS EDITOR
-----------------------

### Description: ###
A utility for removing duplicate sms messages from an sms backup file (must be a txt file - if in xml, simply copy and rename the extension to txt). The utility can also be used to create a separate file with messages from certain contact(s) or number(s) only (both inclusive and exclusive options available).

**NOTE:** This utility was designed to be used with SMSBackup&Restore (android version) backup files, it may or may not work as intended with other backup formats (code is fairly simple to modify if needed for other backup formats).


### Instructions: ###

1. Ensure that the sms backup file is in txt format. 
2. Ensure that the latest version of java is installed.
3. Download the SMSEditor.jar file.
4. Go to the directory where SMSEditor.jar is located.
5. Hold the Shift key and right-click on an empty(space) in the directory.
6. Click "Open command prompt here".
7. Enter the following command without double quotes:
  * "java -jar SMSEditor.jar"
8. Follow on-screen instructions.
9. Enjoy!
